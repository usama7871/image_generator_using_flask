Image Generator
Overview
This project is an image generator that uses a machine learning model to create images based on textual descriptions. It includes a Flask web application (app.py), a machine learning model script (model.py), and an HTML interface (index.html). The model generates images from textual input provided by the user through the web interface.

Requirements
To use this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (3.x recommended)
Flask (pip install Flask)
TensorFlow (for the machine learning model, pip install tensorflow)
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/usama7871/image_generator_using_flask.git
cd image-generator
Install Dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:


python app.py
This will start the Flask server.

Access the Application:
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to use the image generator.

Input Image Descriptions:

Enter textual descriptions in the input box provided on the web interface (index.html).
Click on the 'Generate Image' button to submit the description to the model.
View Generated Images:

The generated images will be displayed on the web page after processing by the machine learning model.
Files
app.py: Flask application script that handles web requests and integrates with the machine learning model.
model.py: Python script containing the machine learning model used for image generation.
index.html: HTML file providing the user interface for entering descriptions and displaying generated images.
Notes
This project assumes basic familiarity with Python, Flask, and TensorFlow.
Adjust the model and application settings as needed for your specific use case or deployment environment.
